# Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster - Decision Tree

The task in the competition organized by kaggle.com was to use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.

In this repository, I presented my results. I only used a **decision tree** algorithm.

The script contains information about data preprocessing, data visualization and the use of machine learning in 4 stages of analysis:
- before categorizing continuous variables,
- after converting continuous variables to categorical,
- with additional variables (a combination of all features),
- with each unique variable value as a new feature.

Additionally, I used correlation, standardization, cross-validation and the importance of features. I also found the best decision tree parameters.

The highest score on kaggle I received was: 0.78468.
